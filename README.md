### Configuration Details

- **LOGIN** = Your Steam account login
- **PASS** = Your Steam account password
- **GAME** = Game IDs you want to idle (e.g., `730` for CS:GO)

To find a game ID, visit the [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/) and locate the ID in the URL (e.g., for CS:GO, the URL is `https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/`, so the ID is `730`).
